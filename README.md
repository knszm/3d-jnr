# Examples from *Classification of joint numerical ranges of three hermitian matrices of size three* (LAA 2018, K.S., Stephan Weis, Karol Å»yczkowski)

Mathematica notebook with the examples from [the paper classifying the possible shapes of 3D qutrit numerical ranges](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.laa.2017.11.017). The notebook generates .stl files containing the mesh approximations to the numerical ranges presented in the paper, exemplyfing the classification. Each classification example with N ellipses and M segments is contained in the file eNsM.stl, e.g. s=2, e=0 is in e2s0.stl.
